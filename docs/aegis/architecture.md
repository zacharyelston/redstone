 
# AEGIS Architecture

## 1. Purpose

The AEGIS architecture defines how language/context packs, runtime caches, and learned local slang integrate into an AI's communication pipeline. It ensures consistent, contextually correct interaction across domains while allowing for local adaptation and evolution.

## 2. Core Components

1. **Global Pack (0.x OID range)**  
   - Universal rules, terminology, and interaction patterns.  
   - Forms the baseline for all contexts.

2. **Domain Packs (1.x OID range)**  
   - Industry/mission-specific rules and lexicons.  
   - Extend and override global pack content for specialized communication.

3. **Local `.1337` Cache (2.1337.x OID range)**  
   - Dynamically updated slang, jargon, or operational terms unique to a unit, site, or team.  
   - Editable in the field without redeploying full packs.

4. **Runtime Merge Engine**  
   - Loads global pack → domain pack → local cache.  
   - Resolves conflicts, applies most specific context first.

5. **Interaction Rule Modules**  
   - Standalone markdown documents defining operational communication standards (e.g., warehouse, military, aviation).  
   - Linked in `index.md` for discoverability.

## 3. Data Flow

```
 [Global Pack]
       ↓
 [Domain Pack]
       ↓
 [Local `.1337` Cache]
       ↓
 [Runtime Merge Engine] → [AI Interaction Layer] → [User]
```

- **Upstream:** Training and authoring teams update packs in a central repository, versioned via OIDs.
- **Downstream:** AI agents pull the latest applicable packs and merge with locally stored `.1337` caches.

---

## 4. Deployment Model

- **Central Repository:** Stores all packs, caches, and interaction rules with OID indexing.
- **Edge Deployment:** AI agents run in domain environments, loading relevant packs from the central repository or offline bundle.
- **Update Cycle:**  
  - *Global/Domain Updates:* Published by maintainers, pulled periodically by agents.  
  - *Local Cache Updates:* Made by field operators, instantly available to the agent.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution

- **Priority:** Local `.1337` cache → Domain pack → Global pack.  
- **Tie-break:** Higher version number wins if two packs define the same OID term.  
- **Manual Override:** Authorized operator can force preference.

---

## 6. Security & Safety

- All packs and caches are signed to ensure authenticity.  
- `.1337` caches are sandboxed with size and scope limits to avoid malicious overload.  
- Merge engine validates syntax and rejects conflicting or unsafe entries.

---

## 7. Example OID Resolution

- `1.4.1` (Aviation ATC phraseology) + `2.1337.5` (Local slang for airport #5) merges to form a composite lexicon:  
  - **Global term:** “Affirmative”  
  - **Domain term:** “Wilco” (ATC-specific)  
  - **Local slang:** “Roger-roger” (humorous informal) — used only in approved informal contexts.

---

## 8. Extensibility

To add a new domain:
1. Reserve a new OID in `oid-map.md` under the 1.x range.
2. Create an interaction rules document under `interaction_rules/`.
3. Define lexicon, templates, and context for that domain.
4. Optionally define `.1337` cache schema for local adaptation.

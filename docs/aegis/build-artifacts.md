# AEGIS Build Artifacts

## 1. Purpose

Build artifacts are essential components in the AEGIS ecosystem, enabling efficient and reliable deployment of AEGIS packs. They encapsulate the compiled and merged data necessary for AI agents to execute domain-specific logic, ensuring consistency, reusability, and faster startup times. By generating and managing these artifacts, developers can maintain clear versioning, streamline distribution, and facilitate runtime updates.

## 2. Artifact Types

AEGIS build artifacts include several key outputs:

- **Merged Runtime Packs**: Comprehensive bundles combining global, domain, and local caches into a single runtime package.
- **`.1337` Cache Exports**: Specialized cache files optimized for fast loading and runtime performance.
- **Compiled OID Maps**: Preprocessed Object Identifier maps that allow quick reference and resolution of domain-specific entities.
- **Domain-Specific Test Suites**: Collections of tests tailored to verify domain logic correctness and integrity.

## 3. Build Process

The generation of AEGIS build artifacts follows these steps:

1. **Pull Global Cache**: Retrieve the global cache containing shared resources and definitions.
2. **Pull Domain Cache**: Fetch the domain-specific cache with relevant data and rules.
3. **Pull Local Cache**: Obtain the local cache for pack-specific overrides and additions.
4. **Merge Caches**: Combine global, domain, and local caches into a unified runtime pack, resolving conflicts and applying precedence rules.
5. **Validate Syntax**: Perform syntax and semantic validation to ensure artifact integrity.
6. **Export Artifacts**: Output the merged data into designated artifact formats such as `.1337` cache files, JSON or YAML exports, and compiled OID maps.
7. **Generate Test Suites**: Produce domain-specific test suites to accompany the runtime pack.

## 4. Storage and Distribution

Artifacts should be stored and distributed using appropriate formats and methods:

- **File Formats**:
  - JSON and YAML for human-readable exports and configuration.
  - Binary formats like `.1337` for optimized runtime loading.
- **Storage Locations**:
  - Local file system for development and testing.
  - Object storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for centralized access.
  - Container images embedding artifacts for deployment in containerized environments.
- **Distribution Methods**:
  - Direct file transfer or synchronization.
  - Package registries or artifact repositories.
  - Container registries for deployment automation.

## 5. Versioning

Effective version control of artifacts is critical:

- **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to track changes and compatibility.
- **OID-Based Version Tags**: Incorporate Object Identifier-based tags to uniquely identify domain-specific versions.
- Maintain metadata within artifacts to record version information and build provenance.

## 6. Example Artifact Layout

A sample directory structure for a compiled AEGIS runtime pack:

```
aegis-runtime/
├── caches/
│   ├── global.1337
│   ├── domain.1337
│   └── local.1337
├── compiled_oid_maps/
│   └── domain_oid_map.json
├── test_suites/
│   └── domain_tests.yaml
├── metadata.json
└── README.md
```

## 7. Deployment Notes

To deploy AEGIS artifacts into an AI agent’s runtime:

- Load the merged runtime pack and associated caches at startup.
- Support hot-reloading mechanisms to update caches and logic without restarting the agent.
- Validate artifact integrity before loading to prevent runtime errors.
- Use version metadata to manage compatibility and rollback if necessary.

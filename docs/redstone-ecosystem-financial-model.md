# RedStone Ecosystem Financial Model - 5 Year Projections

## Executive Summary: Two Revenue Arms Supporting Each Other

**Arm 1: RedStone B2C** - Home/Small Business Subscriptions ("Digital Swiss Army Knife")
**Arm 2: CTXE B2B** - AI Training Data Marketplace

The genius: Every B2C subscriber generates valuable context that feeds the B2B marketplace, while B2B revenues subsidize B2C infrastructure, creating a virtuous cycle.

## The Synergy Effect: How Arms Support Each Other

### B2C Feeds B2B
1. **Every home generates ~100GB of valuable context annually**
2. **Anonymized patterns worth $50-200/year to AI companies**
3. **10M homes = Petabyte of training data worth $500M-2B**

### B2B Subsidizes B2C
1. **Enterprise revenues cover infrastructure costs**
2. **Allows aggressive B2C pricing (loss leader strategy)**
3. **B2B profits fund B2C feature development**

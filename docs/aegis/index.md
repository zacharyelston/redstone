# AEGIS Build Artifacts

## Purpose

Build artifacts are essential for AEGIS packs to ensure consistent, efficient, and reliable deployment of language-context resources. They encapsulate merged and validated language packs, caches, and metadata into structured outputs that AI agents can load at runtime. Artifacts enable version control, distribution, and rapid updates, supporting scalable and maintainable AI communication across domains.

## Artifact Types

- **Merged Runtime Packs:** Combined global, domain, and local `.1337` caches merged into a single, cohesive language-context pack ready for runtime consumption.
- **`.1337` Cache Exports:** Local slang and jargon lexicons extracted and exported independently for site-specific or team-specific customization.
- **Compiled OID Maps:** Structured mappings of Object Identifiers (OIDs) that define inheritance and reference hierarchies between packs.
- **Domain-Specific Test Suites:** Automated tests validating syntax, term consistency, and interaction rules specific to each domain pack.

## Build Process

1. **Pull Sources:** Retrieve the global pack, the selected domain pack, and the relevant `.1337` local caches from source repositories or local storage.
2. **Merge Packs:** Combine the global, domain, and local caches into a unified language-context pack, resolving conflicts according to OID hierarchy rules.
3. **Validate Syntax:** Run syntax and schema validation on the merged pack to ensure correctness and compliance with AEGIS standards.
4. **Generate Artifacts:** Export the merged pack and individual components into specified formats (JSON, YAML, binary), including compiled OID maps and test suites.
5. **Package Artifacts:** Organize generated files into a structured directory layout for easy distribution and deployment.

## Storage and Distribution

- **File Formats:** JSON and YAML are preferred for readability and interoperability; binary formats may be used for optimized runtime loading.
- **Storage Locations:** Artifacts should be stored in versioned directories on local file systems, cloud object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage), or container image layers.
- **Distribution Methods:** Use package repositories, container registries, or direct file transfer to distribute artifacts to AI agent deployment environments.

## Versioning

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to track changes and compatibility of build artifacts.
- Incorporate OID-based version tags to reflect updates in specific language-context packs or caches.
- Maintain changelogs documenting modifications to packs, caches, and test suites to facilitate traceability.

## Example Artifact Layout

## Deployment Notes

- Load merged runtime packs and caches into AI agents at startup to provide the full language-context environment.
- Support hot-reloading of `.1337` caches to update local slang and jargon dynamically without restarting agents.
- Monitor artifact versions and trigger reloads when new versions are deployed to ensure agents use the latest language-context data.

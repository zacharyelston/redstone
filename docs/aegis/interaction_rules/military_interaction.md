# AEGIS Build Artifacts

## 1. Purpose

Build artifacts are essential components in the AEGIS ecosystem, serving as the compiled and optimized outputs that enable AI systems to operate efficiently and consistently. These artifacts encapsulate merged data from multiple sources, ensuring that runtime environments have access to validated, up-to-date knowledge bases, interaction rules, and domain-specific configurations. By generating standardized build artifacts, AEGIS ensures reproducibility, ease of deployment, and seamless integration across diverse operational contexts.

## 2. Artifact Types

AEGIS produces several types of build artifacts to support different runtime requirements:

- **Merged Runtime Packs:** Consolidated collections of global, domain, and local knowledge caches combined into a single, optimized pack for AI consumption.
- **`.1337` Cache Exports:** Specialized lexicons of tactical slang, brevity codes, and jargon used for domain-specific communication, exported in a format suitable for fast lookup.
- **Compiled OID Maps:** Object Identifier (OID) mappings that organize and version different knowledge elements, facilitating precise referencing and update tracking.
- **Domain-Specific Test Suites:** Automated tests that validate the integrity, consistency, and correctness of domain knowledge and interaction rules prior to deployment.

## 3. Build Process

The build process for AEGIS artifacts involves the following steps:

1. **Cache Retrieval:** Pull the latest global, domain-specific, and local caches from their respective sources.
2. **Merging:** Combine caches into a unified dataset, resolving conflicts and harmonizing overlapping entries.
3. **Validation:** Perform syntax and semantic checks to ensure data integrity and compliance with AEGIS standards.
4. **Compilation:** Transform merged data into optimized formats, such as binary or compressed JSON/YAML, suitable for runtime loading.
5. **Exporting:** Generate artifact files and organize them according to predefined directory structures.
6. **Testing:** Run domain-specific test suites against the compiled artifacts to verify correctness.
7. **Packaging:** Prepare artifacts for distribution, including metadata and version tags.

## 4. Storage and Distribution

Recommended practices for storing and distributing AEGIS build artifacts include:

- **File Formats:** Use JSON or YAML for human-readable artifacts; employ binary or compressed formats for performance-critical components.
- **Storage Locations:** Maintain artifacts in version-controlled repositories, object storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage), or container image layers.
- **Distribution Methods:** Distribute artifacts via local file systems for development, cloud storage for scalable access, or embedded within container images for deployment consistency.

## 5. Versioning

Artifact versioning is critical to maintain traceability and compatibility:

- **Semantic Versioning:** Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to indicate backward-incompatible changes, feature additions, and bug fixes.
- **OID-Based Version Tags:** Use Object Identifier-based tags to track specific knowledge elements and their versions within artifacts, enabling fine-grained updates and rollbacks.
- **Metadata Inclusion:** Embed version information within artifact metadata files for runtime reference.

## 6. Example Artifact Layout

A typical compiled AEGIS runtime artifact directory might look like:

```
aegis-runtime/
├── global-pack.json
├── domain-pack.yaml
├── local-pack.json
├── merged-pack.bin
├── 1337-cache.json
├── oid-map.yaml
├── tests/
│   ├── domain-tests.yaml
│   └── integration-tests.yaml
└── metadata.json
```

## 7. Deployment Notes

To deploy AEGIS build artifacts into an AI agent’s runtime environment:

- **Loading:** Load merged packs and caches at agent startup to initialize knowledge bases.
- **Hot-Reload:** Implement hot-reload mechanisms to update `.1337` caches and runtime packs without restarting the agent, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Validation:** Perform runtime validation on loaded artifacts to detect corruption or incompatibility.
- **Fallbacks:** Maintain fallback artifacts or versions to recover from failed updates.
- **Monitoring:** Track artifact versions in use and log any discrepancies for audit and debugging purposes.
